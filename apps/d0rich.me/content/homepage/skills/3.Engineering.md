  My knowledge of Microservices and Dapps enables me to design and develop **distributed systems** that are highly scalable.

  With event-driven approach I enable the development of responsive and scalable applications through asynchronous communication and real-time data processing.

  By utilizing Design patterns, I am able to apply **best practices** and proven solutions to common design problems, resulting in efficient and maintainable code. 

  With these skills, I can deliver high-quality solutions that are secure, scalable, and easy to maintain.
