# Unique style

I was inspired by Persona 5 videogame style. I wanted to create something similar for all my projects. I think it looks pretty cool.

I even created a design system for it. You can find it [here](https://github.com/d0rich/nuxt-design-system). It's only for me, but you can try use it too. Pay attention that it has terrible Developer Experience. Shapes from Persona 5 style are not something browser is optimized to render. So, these components have quite a lot of low level CSS configuration.

I found some articles with references to Persona 5 style during work on these components:
