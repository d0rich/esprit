# Autogenerated images

::alert{type="warning"}
  It appeared that images are required to be generated once and then puppeteer consumes time on build withno reason. Now image generation is extracted to `dog` CLI tool - https://dog.d0rich.me.
::

There is generic set of images you want to generate for every new website:

- `favicon.ico` - to display in browser tabs
- Open Graph image - to display in social networks

_d0xigen_ will generate them for you (if you want to use my style in images 😄) automatically.

## Favicon

_d0xigen_ inserts first letter of your title into `favicon.ico` with predefined background:

![favicon.ico](/favicon.ico)

## Open Graph image

_d0xigen_ inserts title and description of your website into Open Graph image with predefined background:

![og:image](/og/image.jpg)
