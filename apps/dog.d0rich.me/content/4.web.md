# Web UI

Optionally, you can start local web-app to generate images. It uses [backroad](https://backroad.sudomakes.art/) ([streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)-like library) under the hood.

```bash
$ dog web
```

::alert{type="info"}
  [backroad](https://backroad.sudomakes.art/) at the moment lacks crucial features, so user experience is really poor.
